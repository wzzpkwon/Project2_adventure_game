Udacity instructions:

In this project, you'll make a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. You can find an example in the workspace below. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!

As you can see, this is only a very short game with a couple of choices available to the player. We did that on purpose, to keep it simple. If we were making a complete game, we would expand it a great deal, and probably give the player a whole world to explore. But for this project, the idea is to focus on some key things that we need if want to make a working game:

The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
